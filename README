                        ====== sftpd ======

This is a single thread ftp server. Actually, it's an attempt to develop new
kind of client processing mechanism just using one single thread for set of
users, we don't use any pre-forking or other kind of such stuff for connection
handle.

How to build it:
    In order to play with it, just type 'make' within tree folder, and then
    run 'sftpd' binary file using root user. If you want to have an anonymous
    access ftp user must be added.

TODO list:
     1) to rewrite "LIST" cmd, because it's full of crap right now;
     2) to implement following commands: NLST, MODE, MDTM;
     3) to implement more or less logging functionality;
     4) to buckle down to test it.
